This framework is named `winner` what is my wife's name.
This framework is used to build `network server groups`.
Winner is based on epoll, eventfd, c++ atomic and thread.
Winner only supports Linux os. 

Version:
    0.0.1

Winner provide functional as follow:
    1. Create service easily and quickly.
        1) Create service by raw message mechanism (derive from `Service`, see `Service` and `LogService` for more details);
        2) Create service by traditional rpc callback(derive from `CallbackService`, see `CallbackService` and `S2CallbackService` for more deta
        3) Create service by modern rpc coroutine(derive from `CoroutineService`, see `CoroutineService` and `S3CoroutineService` for more detai
        4) Create service by modern lua coroutine(see s1) 
    2. Depoly service more flexible.
        1) Integrate all service in one node(see test case `A`);
        2) Distribute service in different nodes(see test case `B`)
    3. Service can split in one node or in many nodes
        1) In test case `A`, service `LogService` split into [100, 200], for more details see test case `A`;
        2) In test case `B`, node(./data1) provide routing functional, [s2, s3, s4] split into node(./data2) and node(./data3), for more details
    4. Monitor mechanism, every thread has a thread local monitor(instance of Monitor), can used to monitor every thing which is derived from `M
    5. Dispatch message easily, see `DispatcherManager`;
    6. Listen and connect easily, see `Network`;
    7. Easily Manage service, see `ServiceManager`.
    8. Some tools:
        1) protocol generator, see ./tool/protocol
        2) cpp <=> lua, see ./tool/protocol
        2) class code generator, see ./tool/template/class
    9. Many class for develope.

Here are some test case:
  A) Config in ./data:
        This is a simple test;
        There are four service, s1, s2, s3, s4, s5. s1 request s2, s2 request s3, s3 request s4, s4 request s5. 

  B) Config in ./data0, ./data1, ./data2, ./data3
        This is a  complex test;
        There are one service called s1 in data0;
        There are none service in data1, data1 is an route `node`;
        There are three service in data2, s2, s3, s4.
  Comment:
    s1, s2, s3, s4, s5 are service created in ./service(go there and see more details).

Attention:
    Before build this framework, you need install some thirdpart package:
        1) valgrind: ensure framework can found <valgrind/valgrind.h>
        2) openssl: ensure framework can found <openssl/md5.h> and <openssl/sha.h>
        2) libmysqlclient: ensure framework can found <mysql.h>

Install:
    run ./build.sh
    
Testing:
    run ./simple_test.sh

Status:
    I have done some basic testing, and this framework need more testing.

Road Map:
    1) will add http functional;
    2) will modify coroutine for c++, now it is has many limitions;
    3) will add documents and examples;
    4) will optimize performance.

I hope you who are reading this file will help `Winner` to be better.
